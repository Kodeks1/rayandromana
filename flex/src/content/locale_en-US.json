Chronicles place their cultivation in Bohemia as early as 859 A.D., while the first evidence of their export dates back to 903. Most Czech beers are lagers, brewed naturally from hand-picked hops. Czechs like their beer cellar temperature with a creamy, tall head. When ordering draught beer ask for “male pivo” (0.3l) or “pivo” (0.5l).</p><p>The best known Czech beer is the original Pils beer, Pilsner Urquell, brewed in the town of Plzen and exported worldwide. Many Czechs also drink another Plzen brew, Gambrinus, while Bernard from Eastern Bohemia was recently voted best beer of the year. The most widely exported Czech Beer is Budvar (Budweiser in German), the name of which is also used by an unrelated American brew.</p>"
